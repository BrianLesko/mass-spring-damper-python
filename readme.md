# Mass Spring Damper - Simulation using transfer functions 

This simple code simulates the movement of the mass connected to a spring and damper. We test two force inputs and measure the displacement of the mass over time for each simulation. This approach is very quick to calculate.

MatLab was super popular at Ohio State during both my undergraduate and graduate studies of Control system engineering. Can the same content be written in python? Yes. It can.

## Methods / Transfer functions

Taking a Laplace transform of a differential equation and using it to get a transfer function implies some important assumptions.

The system must be linnear. 

The system must be time invariant. 

Why? Read more into what assumptions the Laplace transform takes.  

Due to these assumptions, transfer functions often provide approximations of a system's real response. In practical terms, most physical systems exhibit some degree of non-linearity; for example, friction often does not behave linearly. Since all systems experience some form of friction, perfect linearity is rare.

However, this does not mean that the results from simulations based on transfer functions are not useful. The results are typically accurate within a specified range of operating conditions. Furthermore, the simplicity and efficiency of analyzing linear transfer functions make them invaluable for predicting system behavior accurately enough for many practical applications.
